# resume
# The purpose of this repository is to hold the code dedicated to building the website that holds my resume. You can find it here:
# https://amandahua.com
# If you came here from my website, here's all the code you've been looking for.
# Note: I edit the code on the server (which I'm aware is bad practice, but it's mostly for convenience) so all of the updated code is in master, not staging.

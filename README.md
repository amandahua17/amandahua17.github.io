# resume
# The purpose of this repository is to hold the code dedicated to building the website that holds my resume/portfolio. You can find it at http://amandahua.com. If you came here from my website, here's all the code you've been looking for.
# This used to be hosted on github pages, which is why the repository is amandahua17.github.io, but the files are now being hosted in an AWS EC2 instance.
# Note: I edit the code on the server (which I'm aware is bad practice, but it's mostly for convenience) so all of the updated code is in master, not staging.
